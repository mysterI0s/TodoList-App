# TodoList-App
This is a todolist app I built using flutter.
It has the basic functions such as adding the todo item obviously, it also has the functionality to mark it as done and also deleting it when finished with the item.
It stores its data locally using the sqflite package in flutter. 
Hope you guys find it interesting.
